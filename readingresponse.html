<h2>Synthesis of the Readings</h2>
<p>The VT-Shaped Individual is a concept that has been in development at Virginia Tech in order to prepare their students to solve global problems through collaboration and contextual understanding. The model for the VT-Shaped Individual is an evolved form of the popular T-shaped student, who would have a deep knowledge of a discipline or way of thinking, typically directed towards their major. Leaders in higher education and other organizations have always encouraged the development of T-shaped students, but Virginia Tech’s VT-Shaped model enhances the T while coupling it with the V. The enhanced T “develops cross-cutting technology curricula that allows the majority of [their] students to graduate with 21st century technology expertise,” which then allows all areas of study to integrate the use of technology in their academic pursuit (“Implementation Strategies”). The ‘V’ then enriches the model, bringing in technological literacy, informal communal learning, and guided experiential learning,” typically brought forth through a robust learning curriculum, internships, and education abroad (Provost “Introduction”). This sets Virginia Tech apart from other universities that solely use the T-shaped model, as Virginia Tech incorporates elements of Ut Prosim to promote the student to approach problems ethically, creatively, and critically, as well as teaching them to collaborate with diverse, interdisciplinary teams in order to resolve these challenges. Ultimately, this approach to education is “a “purpose-driven and person-centered” curricular design, engaging the whole person through inclusive connections and the groups in which they participate” (Beyond Boundaries “Description”). Nevertheless, the strength of the model isn’t just the inclusion of the V, but rather the enhancement of the T; integrating technology into all areas of study creates not only a level of connection between all students, but also diversifies the talents within the Liberal Arts programs.</p>
<p>At Virginia Tech, majors within the the STEM departments (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) appear to be the standard, what with Virginia Tech being a school of science and technology. However, they are not the only academic areas at the school; Virginia Tech offers a wide variety of Liberal Arts Majors, as well as a strong Business Program. All of these departments are strong because Virginia Tech sees the opportunity in expanding technological knowledge in any area of study, be it chemistry or art or business or english. The differences between departments at Virginia Tech become obsolete when they become intersected. This model has been compared to that of the Renaissance since “modern science was made possible when artisanal practices--ways of making, doing, and inventing that had the same energy and excitement that we now see at some of the Virginia Tech hackathons and maker’s camps--intersected with a different excitement that surrounded liberal education”(Liberal Arts VT “CLAHS VT-Shaped Learner”). Elizabeth Spiller, dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences, even said, in the wake of the model’s launch, that “we want our students to be able to think from art to science as Galileo did, and from science to art as Leonardo da Vinci did” (VTNews “VT-Shaped Launch”). This, of course, was Sands’ goal all along, what with him pushing to have Thanassis Rikakis, a former vice-Provost at Carnegie Mellon for design, arts, and technology, as the Provost at Virginia Tech, claiming that “Rikakis was just what the university needed to implement what would become Sands’ ambitious vision for shaping the future of Tech” (Roanoke.com “Provost”). </p>
<h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
<li>If this is successful for the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences, how will the same intersection be developed for the STEM Departments?</li>
<li>Will this truly be successful at a big school if technology is not a liberal arts student's strong suit? Will help be readily available?</li>
<li>Will Majors become obsolete if intersection between subjects becomes common, or will Majors evolve to fit the model?</li>
